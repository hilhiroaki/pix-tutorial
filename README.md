# pix-tutorial case

The main purpose of this test was "How to configure a pix key" (available in the file "2. How to configure a Pix key.md"). Along with the idea of structuring a page, I wanted to give context to the instructions I was going to write. And I needed to understand where this type of text would be useful. Since the other topics created were not the focus (send money, transfer method, etc), I just wrote a simple text for each of them. I made just one of the payment examples to illustrate. Therefore, I thought about the following structure:

# Pix
## Pix keys
### How to configure a Pix key
## Payments using Pix
### Send money
#### Transfer method
#### QR code method
### Receive money
#### QR code method
#### Deposit method
