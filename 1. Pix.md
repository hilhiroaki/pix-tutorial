* Leverage market competitiveness and efficiency;
* Lower costs, increase security and improve customer experience;
* Promote financial inclusion;
* Solve payment instruments problems.

## Pix keys

Pix keys are the representation of your account address within the Pix system and can be used to make transferences and payments. The role of Pix keys is to link this data considered "basic" to the complete information that can identify the customer account information, such as financial institution, account number and account type. 
A common client can have up to 5 different Pix keys per account and a juridical person can have up to 20 different Pix keys per account. It is **not** possible to use the **same Pix key** for different accounts or banks.
